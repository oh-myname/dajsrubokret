    <p><b>Poison Tree</b></p>
    <p>by William Blake</p>
    <br>
    <p>I was angry with my friend:</p>
    <p>I told my wrath, my wrath did end.</p>
    <p>I was angry with my foe:</p>
    <p>I told it not, my wrath did grow.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>And I watered it in fears,</p>
    <p>Night and morning with my tears;</p>
    <p>And I sunned it with smiles,</p>
    <p>And with soft deceitful wiles.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>And it grew both day and night,</p>
    <p>Till it bore an apple bright;</p>
    <p>And my foe beheld it shine,</p>
    <p>And he knew that it was mine.</p>
