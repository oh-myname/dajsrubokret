    <h2>A Poison Tree</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I was angry with my friend:</p>
    <p>I told my wrath, my wrath did end.</p>
    <p>I was angry with my foe:</p>
    <p>I told it not, my wrath did grow.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>And I watered it in fears,</p>
    <p>Night and morning with my tears;</p>
    <p>And I sunned it with smiles,</p>
    <p>And with soft deceitful wiles.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>And it grew both day and night,</p>
    <p>Till it bore an apple bright.</p>
    <p>And my foe beheld it shine.</p>
    <p>And he knew that it was mine,</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>And into my garden stole,</p>
    <p>When the night had veiled the pole.</p>
    <p>In the morning glad I see,</p>
    <p>My foe outstretched beneath the tree.</p>
